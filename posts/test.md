## 11ty test

This is my page to test random Hugo features

Syntax highlight just works out of the box. How nice!

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf("Hello world! This is a long string %d\n", 1002);
    return 0;
}
```

Highlighting can also be done starting from a specific number!

```c
void a_function() {
    printf("I am a function");
}
```

It also seems that <code>inline code</code> works just fine too! Well.. my webpage is all monospace, so that isn't a fair comparison. why doesn't this wrap?

I may have to do a little bit of **bolding** to make code stand out.
