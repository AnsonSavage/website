I've been using [Blender](https://www.blender.org) to create artworks for the last 10 years now. It has been a fun hobby. Here are some of my best works. Click the titles to view full-resolution.

## [Peach](/art/peach.jpg)
I made this peach shader using procedural shaders in Cycles.

## [VW Beetle-Beetle](/art/vw_beetle.jpeg)
This is a recreation of an old artwork I made. The original was low poly and very simple. I am very pleased with how the gravel turned out.

## [A Slice of pi](/art/slice_of_pi.jpeg)
I was in my Physics class when I thought of this one.
