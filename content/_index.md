Hi, I'm Nathan.

I am currently a computer science student at BYU in my senior year,
working as a research assistant studying DNS privacy.

In the summers of
[2019](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/projects/5416561530109952/)
and
[2020](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/projects/5735262606327808/)
I participated in the Google Summer of Code with
[Blender](https://www.blender.org) improving the outliner editor. My [commit
history](https://miikahweb.com/en/blender/git-statistics/developers/natecraddock)
shows other areas I contributed to.

Outside of computer science I enjoy hiking, running, reading, and playing piano.
