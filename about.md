# About

Hello! I am Nathan Craddock. I am currently studying Computer Science at Brigham Young University.

I enjoy hiking, coding, 3D graphics, and Linux. I also play the piano and organ.

This website exists as a place for me to dump random web experiements, document cool things I have learned, and share my love for monospaced fonts.

I love to develop for [Blender](https://www.blender.org)! Here is my commit [history](https://miikahweb.com/en/blender/git-statistics/developers/Zachman). I successfully completed the [2019 Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/projects/5416561530109952/) improving Blender's outliner editor. My work was committed in Blender 2.81.

This website is generated with [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) and hosted on Netlify for free.
