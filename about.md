# About

Hello! I am Nathan Craddock. I am currently studying Computer Science at Brigham Young University.

I enjoy hiking, coding, 3D graphics, and Linux. I also play the piano and organ.

I love to develop for [Blender](https://www.blender.org)! Here is my commit [history](https://miikahweb.com/en/blender/git-statistics/developers/Zachman).
I successfully completed the [2019 Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/projects/5416561530109952/) and
[2020 Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/projects/5735262606327808/)
improving Blender's outliner editor. My work was committed in Blender 2.81 and 2.91, with other smaller changes in other versions.
